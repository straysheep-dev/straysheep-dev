## [straysheep.dev](https://straysheep.dev) üåê

Hi, I'm straysheep-dev. üëã

‚öîÔ∏è I'm here learning security from an offensive perspective and documenting things in a useful way as I go.

üõ°Ô∏è I also focus on building defensive (or "visibility") tools, and configuration templates learned from applying offensive techniques to systems.

PowerShell modules and scripts used to configure windows or automate tasks. Plus an extensive walkthrough of Windows specific items such as Hyper-V usage, Windows Sandbox, WSL + USB, logging & monitoring, and more.


## [ansible-configs](https://github.com/straysheep-dev/ansible-configs) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Ansible-white?&logo=ansible&logoColor=black) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/MIT-red) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/GPL--3.0-green) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/BSD--3--Clause-blue)

A collection of ansible roles, with guidance on writing, debugging, and linting ansible code. This includes secrets management, testing plays, and more. The roles are meant to be mixed and used however needed, and offer conditional options for deployment. The main `playbook.yml` file is commented to help you get started.


## [vagrant-configs](https://github.com/straysheep-dev/vagrant-configs) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Vagrant-white?&logo=vagrant&logoColor=blue) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/MIT-red)

How vagrant works, and everything needed to get started using it with security in mind. Includes a sample Vagrantfile for Kali on Hyper-V and VirtualBox showing what provider settings you may want to use. Quirks of Hyper-V and how to resolve them are covered. Lastly, resources to be aware of for building a home lab are linked.


## [terraform-configs](https://github.com/straysheep-dev/terraform-configs) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Terraform-white?&logo=terraform) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/MIT-red)

Ready to use terraform templates, and an easy to follow guide to go from installing, to deploying resources. Also includes guidance on fixing partial deployments, secrets management, and how to generate an ansible inventory from your deployed resources.


## [alert-service](https://github.com/straysheep-dev/alert-service) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Windows-blue?&logo=windows) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Linux-white?&logo=linux&logoColor=black) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/PowerShell-white?style=flat&color=blue) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python3-blue?&logo=python&logoColor=gold) ![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/MIT-red)

Webhook based alerting (Slack, Discord...) for events, account access, honey files, etc. It's meant as a follow up to [IppSec's video on this topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9owPmgmfvo&t=1545s), with ready-to-use examples of sending an alert on both Windows and Linux using [cyber deception](https://github.com/strandjs/IntroLabs/blob/master/IntroClassFiles/navigation.md) to catch malicious behavior early.
